<h1>Kirpatrick Point Location</h1>
<p>                
  The simplest way to perform point location is to use the plum line algorithm.
  Plum line is a very simple algorithm that runs in O(n) time.  In plum line,
  you shoot a ray in an arbitrary direction from the query point to infinity.
  Record the number of times the ray intersects a polygon. If this number is
  odd, then the point is inside of the polygon. If not, then the point is
  outside of the polygon.
</p>
<p>
  Now this works well, however it is not fast enough if you are testing the
  location of many points.  Kirpatrick's algorithm runs in O(log n) time after
  O(n) preprocessing. One thing to note is that if the polygon has holes, then
  the preprocessing will take O(n log n) time.
</p>
<h1>Preprocessing</h1>
<p>
  The first step in the preprocessing is to triangulate the polygon. This is the
  most computationally expensive step. There exists an O(n) triangulation
  algorithm for simple polygons without holes, however, it is incredibly
  complicated and difficult to implement. Therefore, most implementations will
  use the more simple O(n log n) algorithm (triangulating with monotone
  polygons).
</p>
<p>
  The next step is to surround the polygon with a triangle. This allows for a
  simple, O(1) sanity check of whether the point could be inside of the polygon.
  It does not matter how much extra space is between the polygon and the outer
  triangle, as long as the polygon is completely contained within the triangle.
  It is trivial to find this triangle in O(n) time by simply sweeping the 3
  lines of an equilateral triangle from infinity towards the polygon.
</p>
<p>
  Next, find the convex hull of the polygon. This can be done in O(n) time using
  <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~athens/cs601/Melkman.html">Melkman's convex
  hull algorithm</a>. Triangulate each pocket of the polygon. Then, triangulate
  between the convex hull and the outer triangle. This can be done in linear
  time by finding the tangents from each vertex of the outer triangle to the
  convex hull of the polygon. Triangulating between the tangents is trivial.
</p>
<p>
  Note that when triangulating, each triangle should have a mark denoting
  whether it is inside of the polygon or not.
</p>
<p>
  For the next step, you first need to convert the triangulation into a graph
  where the vertices are nodes and the triangle edges are graph edges. The
  next step is to find an independent set of low degree vertices. A set of
  vertices is <b>independent</b> if and only if there are no edges between any
  of the vertices in the set. For this algorithm, all of the vertices must also
  have degree less than or equal to 8. It can be shown using 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic">Euler characteristic</a>
  that at least n/2 vertices in the triangulation will have degree less than or
  equal to 8. 
</p>
<p>
  Now find and remove an independent set of low degree vertices. Note that the
  independent set should not include any of the 3 vertices from the outer
  triangle. This will leave a series of star-shaped holes in the polygon that
  will be larger than triangles.  Retriangulate these holes. Note that the
  number of new triangles in the hole is at most 6 (since the vertex has degree less
  than or equal to 8). Now compare the new triangles (from the holes) with the
  old triangles (connected to a vertex in the removed independent set). For each
  new triangle, determine which of the old triangles intersect it. Keep pointers
  to those triangles. Unchanged triangles should have a pointer back to a copy
  of themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Continue to find and remove the independent sets until you are only left with
  the outermost triangle. At this point, the preprocessing is done and you are left
  with a data structure similar to a tree. Each independent set removed creates a
  level in the tree. The references to overlapping triangles form the tree
  edges. The root of the tree is the outermost triangle, whereas the lowest
  level of the tree is the original triangulation. One important thing to note
  is that the height of the tree will be O(log n).
</p>

<h1>Locating a point</h1>
<p>
  Let <i>p</i> be a point to locate. Now we can simply traverse down the tree of
  our data structure. At each level we know which current triangle the point is inside.
  When going to the next level of the tree, compare <i>p</i> to each of
  triangles that "overlapped" the current triangle. Note that this is a O(1)
  operation since there are at most 6 "overlapped" triangles. By repeating this
  process, you will eventually reach the original, full triangulation. At that
  point, you will know which of those triangles <i>p</i> falls in. Since each
  triangle in the original triangulation kept a mark as to whether it was
  inside of the polygon, we can tell in constant time whether the point is in
  the polygon.
</p>
<p>
  At each level of the tree, we are spending O(1) time. Since there are O(log n)
  levels of the tree, the entire point location takes O(log n) time.
